We must now expand the swapfile before running the next set of commands. To do this type and enter into the Terminal the following line.
 
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
 
The change the number on CONF_SWAPSIZE = 100 to CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048. Having done this press Ctrl-X, Y, and then Enter Key to save these changes. This change is only temporary and we will be changing it back. To have these changes affect anything we must restart the swapfile by entering the following command to the terminal. Then we will resume Terminal Commands as normal.

sudo systemctl restart dphys-swapfile

This | make | Command will take over an hour to install and there will be no indication of how much longer it will take. It may also freeze the monitor display. Be ultra patient and it will work. Once complete you are most of the way done. Then we will resume terminal commands.
